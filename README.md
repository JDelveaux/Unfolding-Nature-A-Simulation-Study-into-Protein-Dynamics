# Unfolding Nature: A Simulation Study into Protein Dynamics
A report submitted for the degree of  MSc in Non-Equilibrium Systems

 Herein we have determined the potential of mean force (PMF) for a mechanical unfolding simulation
 of two small protein structures, an ↵-helix and-hairpin, using umbrella sampling (US) and the
 weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM). Results show a free energy change of 12.2 ± 2.8 and
 23.8 ± 2.1 kcal/mol for the helix and hairpin respectively, with the uncertainty in the calculations
 obtained through various bootstrapping methods. Structural analysis in conjunction with force
distance plots indicate no major transitions or energy barriers throughout the dynamics, nor does
 the PMF reveal any intermediate structures for either protein; though high degrees of uncertainty
 may mask the results. We propose these finding elucidate the difficulty of predicting protein
 secondary structure from chemical principles
